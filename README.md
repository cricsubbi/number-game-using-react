About how the game works:

Here the user gives an input number b/w 1-100 nd we subtract it with a random generated no b/w the given range and if the 
Difference between the no is zero it prints success if the difference is 1-4 then hot or 5-15 then warm if greater then cold and
If it's a success the same UI elements will print again with range increased till 200 this will happen till 300 
and then it will go back again to 1-100.
